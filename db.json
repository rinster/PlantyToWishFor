        "latin_name": "Alocasia baginda 'Dragon Scale'",
        "plant_desc": "Alocasia foliage is large and ribbed. The arrow-shaped leaves sit on large petioles and they can reach up to 2m long! It doesn't cope well with direct sunlight so keep it in partial shade. ‘Calidora’ looks great in a pot or looming over a flower bed. 'Dragon Scale' bears silvery-grey leaves with dark green primary and secondary veins, somewhat resembling large scales. It bears purple spathe flowers but these are insignificant compared with the foliage",
        "care_level": "Moderate",
        "care_directions": "In temperate climates, Alocasia is usually grown in a heated greenhouse or as a conservatory plant. Alocasias need rich soil that is moist (not saturated) but well-drained. Plant in partial shade. Indoors, grow in filtered light. Provide high humidity. In warm climates, similar to their native humid and tropical Southeast Asia, elephant ears will grow as perennials. In cooler areas they will need to be replanted each year.",

        "plant_desc": "The Swiss cheese plant needs extra space within a home as it grows fairly tall when it matures. This climbing shrub is an ideal plant for a conservatory or for large rooms. Sturdy support is essential. If your aim is to grow a tall plant with large leaves, you must care for the ariel roots by either pushing them into compost or use a moss stick. The Variegated Monstera is a beautiful rare form, perfect for low light situations, this cultivar of Monstera deliciosa has leaves up to 3’ wide with large holes.",
        "care_level": "Hard",
        "care_directions": "Temperatures between 65-80ºF (18-27ºC) are ideal. Lower than 65ºF (18Cº) will slow down this plants growth and below 50ºF (10ºC) will stop growth. A fairly bright room or bright with plenty of shade is best. Direct sunlight will damage the leaves and not enough light can slow growth down. A peat based potting soil mix with perlite or sand is ideal. Soil that drains well is needed.",
