# Planty To Wish For

This is a fun project for me to practice DOM manipulation with no front-end frameworks. Just pure vanilla JS, SASS, webpack and babel. I built this entire project from scratch. :) 

## Installation and Setup
Installing this project is easy. Simply download this github repo or clone to your local machine.
<br/>
From the command line, `cd` into the root folder and run the following script to install packages and dependencies:
```
npm install 
```
Run build script to create the `dist` file: 
```
npm run build
```
Lastly, start up the project with the script below! Easy peezy :)
```
npm run start
```
