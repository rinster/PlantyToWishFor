# Planty To Wish For - IN PROGRESS

This is a fun project for me to practice DOM manipulation with no front-end frameworks. Just pure vanilla JS, SASS, webpack and babel. The purpose of this project was to cement my knowledge of DOM manipulation, JavaScript and understand how front-end frameworks work under the hood.

I built this entire project from scratch. :) 

## Installation and Setup
Installing this project is easy. Simply download this github repo or clone to your local machine.
<br/>
From the command line, `cd` into the root folder and run the following script to install packages and dependencies:
```
npm install 
```
Run build script to create the `dist` file: 
```
npm run build
```
Lastly, start up the project with the script below! Easy peezy :)
```
npm run start
```

## Additionally Planned Features:
* [ ] On page load, collect user input budget
* [ ] Print PDF of wishlist
* [ ] Dark mode UI toggle 
* [ ] List to move in side drawer on mobile view
* [ ] Dynamic update on realtime Budget calculator for users to track if they are staying within budget
* [ ] Allow user to manipulate dollar value of plant to take into consideration the changing market prices
